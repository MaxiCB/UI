            <h1>Help Tranform Broken Lives</h1>
            <p>
              Ranging from as young as 7 and as old as 75 years some have recently fled their homes while others have been displaced for decades. 
              We are proud to spread the knowledge of GlobalGiving who are working with the courageous people who are sharing their stories below. 
              Their partners are providing education and job training, psycho-social support, healthcare, and even agriculture assistance.
            </p>
            <p>
              The U.S. has a long history of providing welcome to those needing safety. For decades, life-saving protection for refugees has been possible through the U.S. resettlement program and asylum. 
              Today, we see these pathways to safety for those who have fled persecution and violence coming under attack, leaving some of the world’s most vulnerable people behind. 
              Every day teams worldwide are hard at work advocating for solutions for refugees, asylum seekers, asylees, Temporary Protected Status recipients, DREAMers and other marginalized people worldwide.

            <h1>Alia</h1>
            <p>
              Alia fled her home in Aleppo, Syria and is currently living in Damour, Lebanon. 
              She shared her story through Gruppo Aleimar, an Italian NGO which provides free nutritious meals to refugees in the Damour area. 
              Alia is 7 years old.
            </p>
            <p>
              “The last thing I remember of Syria, before we left, was when my mother was taking me from our place to our grandparents. 
              The roads were full of dead corpses. I saw dead people with no heads or no hands or legs. I was so shocked I couldn’t stop crying. 
              To calm me down, my grandfather told me they were mean people, but I still prayed for them, because even if some considered them mean, they were still dead human beings. 
              Back at home, I left a friend in Syria, her name was Rou’a. I miss her a lot and I miss going to school with her. I used to play with her with my Atari but I couldn’t bring it with me. 
              I also used to have pigeons, one of them had eggs, I would feed them and care for them. I’m worried about them, I really pray someone is still caring for them. 
              But here I have a small kitten that I really love! I miss my home a lot. I hope one day we’ll be back and things will be just like before.”
